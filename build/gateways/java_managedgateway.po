msgid "Gateway plays an important role in the device management of devices connected to it. Many of these devices will be too basic to be managed. For a managed device, the device management agent on the gateway acts as a proxy for the connected device. The protocol used by the gateway to manage the connected devices is arbitrary, and there need not be a device management agent on the connected devices. It is only necessary for the gateway to ensure that devices connected to it perform their responsibilities as managed devices, performing any translation and processing required to achieve this. The management agent in gateway will act as more than a transparent tunnel between the attached device and the Watson IoT Platform."

msgid "For example, It is unlikely that a device connected to a gateway will be able to download the firmware itself. In this case, the gateway’s device management agent will intercept the request to download the firmware and perform the download to its own storage. Then, when the device is instructed to perform the upgrade, the gateway’s device management agent will push the firmware to the device and update it."
