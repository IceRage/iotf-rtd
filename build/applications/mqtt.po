A shared subscription might be needed if a back-end enterprise application can not keep up with the number of messages being published to a specific topic space. For example if many devices were publishing messages that are being processed by a single application. It might be helpful to leverage the load balancing capability of a shared subscription. IoT Platform shared subscription support is limited to non-durable subscriptions only."
