msgid "The primary mechanism that devices and applications use to communicate with the IBM Watson IoT platform is MQTT; this is a protocol designed for the efficient exchange of real-time data with sensor and mobile devices."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:11
msgid "MQTT runs over TCP/IP and, while it is possible to code directly to TCP/IP, you might prefer to use a library that handles the details of the MQTT protocol for you. You will find there's a wide range of MQTT client libraries available at mqtt.org_, with the best place to start looking being the `Eclipse Paho project`_. IBM contributes to the development and support of many of these libraries."

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:21
msgid "MQTT 3.1 is the version of the protocol that is in widest use today. Version 3.1.1 contains a number of minor enhancements, and has been ratified as an OASIS Standard."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:24
msgid "One reason for using version 3.1.1 is that the maximum length of the MQTT Client Identifier (ClientId) is increased from the 23 character limit imposed by 3.1. The IoT service will often require longer ClientId's and will accept long ClientId's with either version of the protocol however some 3.1 client libraries check the ClientId and enforce the 23 character limit."

msgid "The class of thing that your MQTT client identifies itself to the service as will determine the capabilities of your client once connected as well as the mechanism through which you will need to authenticate."

msgid "Quality of service"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:53
msgid "The MQTT protocol provides three qualities of service for delivering messages between clients and servers: \"at most once\", \"at least once\" and \"exactly once\". Events and commands can be sent using any quality of service level, however you should carefully consider whether what the right level is for your needs.  It is not a simple case that QoS2 is \"better\" than QoS0."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:61
msgid "At most once (QoS0)"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:62
msgid "The message is delivered at most once, or it might not be delivered at all. Delivery across the network is not acknowledged, and the message is not stored. The message could be lost if the client is disconnected, or if the server fails. QoS0 is the fastest mode of transfer. It is sometimes called \"fire and forget\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:68
msgid "The MQTT protocol does not require servers to forward publications at QoS0 to a client. If the client is disconnected at the time the server receives the publication, the publication might be discarded, depending on the server implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:73
msgid "When sending real-time data on an interval we recommend using QoS0.  If a single message goes missing it does not really matter as another message will be sent shortly after containing newer data.  In this scenario the extra cost of using higher quality of service does not result in any tangible benefit."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:80
msgid "At least once (QoS1)"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:81
msgid "The message is always delivered at least once. It might be delivered multiple times if there is a failure before an acknowledgment is received by the sender. The message must be stored locally at the sender, until the sender receives confirmation that the message has been published by the receiver. The message is stored in case the message must be sent again."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:89
msgid "Exactly once (QoS2)"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:90
msgid "The message is always delivered exactly once. The message must be stored locally at the sender, until the sender receives confirmation that the message has been published by the receiver. The message is stored in case the message must be sent again. QoS2 is the safest, but slowest mode of transfer. A more sophisticated handshaking and acknowledgement sequence is used than for QoS1 to ensure no duplication of messages occurs."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:97
msgid "When sending commands we recommend using QoS2.  In many cases, when processing commands you want to know that the command will only be actioned, and that it will be actioned only once.  This is one of the clearest examples of when the additional overhead of QoS2 has a clear benefit."

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:104
msgid "Subscription Buffers and Clean Session"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:105
msgid "Each subscription from either a device or application is allocated a buffer of 5000 messages.  This allows for any application or device to fall behind the live data it is processing and build up a backlog of up to 5000 pending messages for each subscription it has made.  Once the buffer fills up, any new message will result in the oldest message in the buffer being discarded."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:111
msgid "The subscription buffer can be accessed using MQTT clean session option.  If clean session is set to false, a subscriber will start receiving messages from the buffer. If clean session is set to true, the buffer is reset."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:115
msgid "This limit applies regardless of the quality of service setting used. Thus it is possible that a message sent at QoS1 or QoS2 may not be delivered to an application that is unable to keep up with the messages rate for the subscription(s) it has made."

msgstr ""

#: ../docs/reference/mqtt/index.rst:130
msgid "The maximum payload size is 131072 bytes.  If messages with payloads larger than this limit are sent, the client will be disconnected and the following log message will appear in the Diagnostic Logs if the client is a device:"
