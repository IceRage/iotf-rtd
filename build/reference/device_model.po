msgid "The device model describes the metadata and management characteristics of a device. The device database in the Watson IoT platform is the master source of device information. Applications and managed devices are able to send updates to the database such as a location or the progress of a firmware update. Once these updates are received by the Watson IoT platform, the device database is updated, making the information available to applications."
