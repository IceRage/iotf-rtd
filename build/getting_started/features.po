msgid "Securely connect your devices, gateways and applications directly to the Watson IoT platform via MQTT.  See the section on MQTT in the :ref:`reference material <ref-mqtt>` to learn more about the advantages of using this protocol.  Model the data from your device as events and control the flow of events into your applications."

#: ../docs/getting_started/features.rst:26
msgid "Optionally, allow the Watson IoT platform to manage the lifecycle of your devices by implementing support for the Watson IoT platform's device management protocol in your devices.  The means by which the device connects to the service does not affect the device management protocol, which functions the same for directly connected, indirectly connected, and gateway devices."

msgid "External Service Integration"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/features.rst:34
msgid "The Watson IoT platform supports integration with external services to bring data and operations supported by other online services into the platform, allowing your application and device developers to seemlessly interact with those services without ever leaving the comfort of the Watson IoT platform APIs."
