msgid "When you register with the Watson IoT platform you are given an organization ID, this is a unique 6 character identifier for your account."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/concepts.rst:9
msgid "**Organizations** ensure your data is only accessible from your devices and applications.  Once registered, devices and API keys are bound to a single organization.  When an application connects to the service using an API key it registers with the organization that \"owns\" the API key."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/concepts.rst:14
msgid "For your security it is impossible for cross-organization communication within the Watson IoT platform eco-system, intentional or otherwise.  The only way to transmit data between two organizations it to explicitly create two applications, one within each organization, that communicate with each other to act as a relay between the organizations."

msgid "Managed and Unmanaged Devices"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/concepts.rst:33
msgid "**Managed devices** are defined as devices which contain a management agent. A management agent is a set of logic which allows the device to interact with the Watson IoT platform Device Management service via the Device Management protocol. Managed devices can perform device management operations including location updates, firmware download and updates, and reboot and factory reset."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/concepts.rst:38
msgid "An **unmanaged device** is a device without a management agent. An unmanaged device can still connect to the Watson IoT platform and send and receive events and commands. However, it cannot send any device management requests, or perform any of the device management operations."

msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/concepts.rst:59
msgid "Gateways are a specialized class of Device. They have the combined capabilities of an Application and a Device allowing them to serve as access points providing connectivity to the service for other devices without the ability to directly connect."

msgstr ""

msgid "Events are the mechanism by which **devices** publish data to the Watson IoT platform.  The device controls the content of the event and assigns a name for each event it sends."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/concepts.rst:73
msgid "When an event is received by the Watson IoT platform from a device the credentials of the connection on which the event was received are used to determine from which device the event was sent.  With this architecture it is impossible for a device to impersonate another device."

msgid "**Applications** are able to process events from devices in real time.  When an application receives an event it has visibility of the source of the event and the data contained in that event.  Applications can be configured to subscribe to all events from all devices, a subset of events, a subset of devices or a combination of these events."

msgid "Historical Event Storage"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/concepts.rst:90
msgid "Historical event storage allows users to store the data from devices added to their Watson IoT platform organization. Historical event storage activity and duration can be controlled from the settings panel in the Watson IoT platform dashboard."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/concepts.rst:94
msgid "When changing settings for historical data storage, keep in mind that storing data for longer periods of time will affect your billing. Also, care should be taken when disabling historical data storage, as upon disabling data storage for your organization, all stored data will be deleted, and cannot be recovered."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/getting_started/concepts.rst:99
msgid "Historical event storage uses an MQTT Quality of Service level of 0 (delivery at most once), so some data may be lost. Please note that only messages of up to 4096 bytes are stored."

msgid "The device must determine which action to take on receipt of any given command, and even controls which commands it will subscribe to in the first place.  It is possible to design your device to listen for any command, or to simply subscribe to a set of specific commands."
