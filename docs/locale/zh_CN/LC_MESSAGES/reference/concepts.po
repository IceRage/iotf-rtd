msgid "When you register with the Internet of Things Foundation you are given an organization ID, this is a unique 6 character identifier for your account."
msgstr ""
"向 Internet of Things Foundation 注册时，将为您提供组织标识，这是您帐户的包含 6 个字符的唯一标识。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:10
msgid "**Organizations** ensure your data is only accessible from your devices and applications.  Once registered, devices and API keys are bound to a single organization.  When an application connects to the service using an API key it registers with the organization that \"owns\" the API key."
msgstr ""
"**组织** 确保仅可从设备和应用程序访问您的数据。注册后，设备和 API 密钥绑定到单个组织。应用程序使用 API 密钥连接到设备时，它会向拥有该 API 密钥的组织注册。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:15
msgid "For your security it is impossible for cross-organization communication within the Internet of Things Foundation eco-system, intentional or otherwise.  The only way to transmit data between two organizations it to explicitly create two applications, one within each organization, that communicate with each other to act as a relay between the organizations."
msgstr ""
"出于安全考虑，无法在 Internet of Things Foundation 生态系统中进行跨组织通信，不管是有意还是无意。在两个组织之间传输数据的唯一方式是显式创建两个应用程序（每个组织中各创建一个），这些应用程序相互通信以充当组织之间的中继。"

msgid "An application is anything that has a connection to the internet and wants to interact with data from devices and/or control the behaviour of those devices in some manner."
msgstr ""
"应用程序是连接到因特网，并且希望与来自设备的数据进行交互和/或以某种方式控制这些设备的行为的任何对象。"

msgid "Events"
msgstr ""

msgid "Events are the mechanism by which **devices** publish data to the Internet of Things Foundation.  The device controls the content of the event and assigns a name for each event it sends."
msgstr ""
"事件是 **设备** 用于将数据发布到 Internet of Things Foundation 的机制。设备控制事件的内容，并为其发送的每个事件分配名称。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:51
msgid "When an event is received by the IoT Foundation the credentials of the connection on which the event was received are used to determine from which device the event was sent.  With this architecture it is impossible for a device to impersonate another device."
msgstr ""
"IoT Foundation 接收到事件时，将使用用于接收该事件的连接的凭证来确定是从哪个设备发送了该事件。由于使用这种体系结构，设备将无法模拟其他设备。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:56
msgid "**Devices** are unable to receive events, regardless of whether they are its own events or those of another device."
msgstr ""
"**设备** 无法接收事件，无论这些是其自己的事件还是其他设备的事件。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:59
msgid "**Applications** are able to process events from devices in real time.  When an application receives an event it has visibility of the source of the event and the data contained in that event.  Applications can be configured to subscribe to all events from all devices, a subset of events, a subset of devices or a combination of these events."
msgstr ""
"**应用程序** 可以实时处理来自设备的事件。应用程序收到事件时，它能够查看事件的源以及该事件中包含的数据。应用程序可以配置为预订来自所有设备的所有事件、部分事件、部分设备或这些事件的组合。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:72
msgid "The device must determine which action to take on receipt of any given command, and even controls which commands it will subscribe to in the first place.  It is possible to design your device to listen for any command, or to simply subscribe to a set of specific commands."
msgstr ""
"设备必须确定在收到任何给定命令时要采取的操作，甚至控制首先它要预订哪些命令。可以将设备设计为侦听任何命令，或仅预订一组特定命令。"

"受管设备和非受管设备"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:79
msgid "**Managed devices** are defined as devices which contain a management agent. A management agent is a set of logic which allows the device to interact with the Internet of Things Foundation Device Management service via the Device Management protocol. Managed devices can perform device management operations including location updates, firmware download and updates, and reboot and factory reset."
msgstr ""
"**受管设备**定义为包含管理代理程序的设备。管理代理程序是一组逻辑，允许设备通过“设备管理”协议与“Internet of Things Foundation 设备管理”服务进行交互。受管设备可以执行诸多设备管理操作，包括位置更新、固件下载和更新以及重新引导和恢复出厂设置。"
